.. warning::
   This package contains convenience copies of one or more Javascript libraries
   which in some cases contain known security vulnerabilities. They are
   included for testing purposes and not intended for security sensitive
   production deployments. It's assumed that downstream repackaging and
   distribution channels will supply their own repacement Javascript libraries
   with backported security fixes when relevant.

JQuery-Migrate JavaScript library packaged for setuptools (easy_install) / pip.

This package is intended to be used by **any** project that needs these files.

It intentionally does **not** provide any extra code except some metadata
**nor** has any extra requirements. You MAY use some minimal support code from
the XStatic base package, if you like.

You can find more info about the xstatic packaging way in the package `XStatic`.
